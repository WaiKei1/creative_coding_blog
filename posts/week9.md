# Notes

This week slides introduce AI tools for coding and how to effectively collaborate with AI coding agents so that we can use these agents for A3.

And these notes is being made for me to understand how things work.

### Vibe Coding

Vibe Coding is a modern, flexible approach to programming that prioritizes intuition, creativity, and flow over rigid structure.

It emphasizes feeling over rules which writing code that "feels right" rather than strictly following conventions

TL;DR: Coding with flow intuition, and fun - not just strict logic.

---

### Challenges of AI Coding Agents

They could be over-enthusistic like a toddler which lead to bad decisions, over complicated or bloated code, etc.

**HOW TO AVOID??**

Verify AI's understanding, break works into parts, test & review the code, and ask AI explain and make sure to understand what is being made.

---

### Two Brains (Human + AI Synergy)

Working with AI agent, you will be more powerful than working alone. It is a skill that improves with practice.

---

### Multiple Agents

Different AI agents have different strengths. Make sure to understand and choose wisely.

---

### Understand AI fundamentals (tokens, context windows)

These AI fundamentals help us to control well

**Reference Folder**

This is a way to guide the AI. By providing more details (like coding style, existing code, etc), basically treat them like a innocent baby and tell them what to do.

It is a folder or files named `/reference/` and fill it with snippets of the preferred code style, pattern, or structure. After that point it to these files so it can generate something accurately.
