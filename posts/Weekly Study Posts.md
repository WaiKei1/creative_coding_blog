# Week 1

## Session 1: 4 Mar

### Notes (In class)

This is the first class that we had for creative coding, our lecturer introduced p5, a javascript web editor. Here's some notes of basic coding:

1. Don't need semicolon ";" in the code, semicolon doesn't really effect the code
2. The code need to consistent
3. "//" "/_ blablabla _/" comments, these are for us to read, the computer will ignore this (to explain how your code is going to work/happen)
4. curly bracket {} is defining the scope, outside the canvas had a big curly bracket
5. (x, y, z) is a parameters/arguements
6. javascript read the instructions by order, from top to down
7. console. log, a built-in function that allows you to output messages or values to the console, commonly used for understanding what is happening in your code
8. the string is important to let the code work (")
9. everything start at zero
10. understand each line of the code will help us understand how to code
11. str = string

### Understanding the _for_ loop

A _for_ loop in Javascript consists three parts (initialization, condition, and update). They usually appear together in a single line to control the loop's behaviour.

![for loop syntax](/static/w01s1/for%20loop%20syntax.png)

for (initialization; condition; update)

for (**starting point, ending point** _(loop runs while this is true)_, **how it moves** _(change the loop variable each time the loop runs)_)

Example 1

    for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++)

    It wil start from 0 and increase 1 each time until 4

Example 2

    for (let i = 2; i < total_squares - 2; i += 2)

    It will start from 2 and stop 2 columns early and skips every other column

### Undestanding _frameCount_ and _frameRate_?

- frameCount

  Count how many frames have passed since the sktech started, increases by 1 per frame

- frameRate

  Control how many frames per second (FPS) the sketch runs. Default = 60 FPS

Example

    function setup() {
        frameRate(30);
        }

    slow down animation (30 FPS instead of 60)

---

### What is _const_ ?

const = constant, a fixed variable that **cannot be change after it's declared**. it is best used for values that stay the same throughout the code.

- **Example**
  - const total_sqaure = 10
  - const total_rows = 6

### Homework

![a drippy lemon](logo.svg)

^ images are written like this: `![description](file_path/file_name.png)`

## This is h2

_This is italic._[^1]

[^1]: This is a footnote, _which can also be italic_.

**This is bold.**

Hyperlinks can be written like this: `[text](https://URL)`

You can find a markdown cheat-sheet [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

## Maths:

... which can be written inline, like this: $\{ x, y, z \} \in \N$

... or block, like this:

$$ x^2 + y^2 = z^2 $$

<script type="module">

    console.log (`hello world! ðŸš€`)

    const iframe  = document.getElementById (`coding_train_video`)
    iframe.width  = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
    iframe.height = iframe.width * 9 / 16

## Embedding p5 sketches:

<iframe id="falling_falling" src="https://editor.p5js.org/capogreco/full/Fkg05m7aA"></iframe>

<script type="module">

    const iframe  = document.getElementById (`falling_falling`)
    iframe.width  = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
    iframe.height = iframe.width * 9 / 16 + 42

</script>

## Canvas API

<canvas id="canvas_example"></canvas>

<script type="module">
    const cnv = document.getElementById (`canvas_example`)
    cnv.width = cnv.parentNode.scrollWidth
    cnv.height = cnv.width * 9 / 16

    const ctx = cnv.getContext (`2d`)
    const pos = {
        x: -100,
        y: cnv.height / 2 - 50
    }
    
    function draw_frame () {
        ctx.fillStyle = `turquoise`
        ctx.fillRect (0, 0, cnv.width, cnv.height)

        ctx.fillStyle = `hotpink`
        ctx.fillRect (pos.x, pos.y, 100, 100)

        pos.x += 2

        if (pos.x > cnv.width) {
            pos.x = -100
        }

        requestAnimationFrame (draw_frame)
    }

    draw_frame ()
