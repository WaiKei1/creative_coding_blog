# Notes

### Canvas API

The basic setup for Canvas API is a HTML file and a JavaScript file (script.js). More information can be found in [Canvas API](https://blog.science.family/240320_canvas_api).

I chose the video artwork [r = θ](https://sodeoka.com/r-t) by Yoshi Sodeoka.

As the title suggests, the artist uses the mathematical formula r = θ as a structural foundation, offering a mathematical lens through which to view the world. This formula generates spiral patterns.

![r = θ](/w04s1/r%20=%20θ.png)

Sodeoka takes this structure and overlays it onto real-world footage, creating a unique perspective that blends reality with mathematical abstraction.

Throughout the video, the visuals constantly shift between natural imagery and abstract, mathematical representations. This back-and-forth creates a sense of randomness and chaos, contrasting with the orderly structure of the spiral. It feels like the artist is showing us how the world might look if we could see the hidden patterns and equations behind everything around us. This balance between structure and randomness creates a rich, layered experience that feels visually engaging.
