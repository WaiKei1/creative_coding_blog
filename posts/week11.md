# Homework

### Session 1: 22 May

![hw11a_1](/w11s1/hw11_1.png)

Click `Cmd + Shift + 5 %` at the same time to do screen recording.

This video shows the current progress that I have, I did not recorded the process of coding because I think it will be super boring cause I'll just keep on Googling, and repeating typing + deleting only. And sometimes I'll take longer time if I'm extremely tired. XX

So I decided to just introduce the inspiration, the community of practice and the code that I currently have.

<iframe id="A3 Progress" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WiR9gLFxh6U?si=8JjkxjiA7cS90PPv" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<script type="module">

    console.log (`hello world! üöÄ`)

    const iframe  = document.getElementById (`A3 Progress`)
    iframe.width  = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
    iframe.height = iframe.width * 9 / 16

### A3 Project Plan: Fun Feedback Generator for UIUX Designers

**Community of Practice**

**- Domains:** UIUX Design

**- Repertoire:** Wireframing, Prototyping, Design Critique, User Testing, Figma, Portfolio

**- Values:** User-centered thinking, iterative improvement, mutual support through constructive feedback

I chose this community because feedback is a core practice. Both online groups and uni classes revolve around giving and receiving critiques to sharpen our designs. The need to "make feedback less intimidating and more engaging" became my central motivation.

---

### Code Explanation:

The project is a simple JavaScript (and HTML/CSS) web app that:

- Randomly generates design feedback sentences

- Combines genuine critique templates with funny/slang/meme language

It uses:

- Math.random() to pick feedback sentences

- EventListener for a button click to display new feedback

- A touch of CSS styling for a light and fun UI

---

### Practical Description

When the user clicks a button labeled something like "Give me feedback", the site returns:

A short feedback sentence like:

**"This layout flows well, but try reducing cognitive load."** OR **‚ÄúYour spacing is tighter than my deadlines ü´† ‚Äî try adding more padding, please.‚Äù**

The idea is to reflect the real value of critique ‚Äî but filter it through a funny, memorable, or casual lens to reduce stress and encourage exploration.

I see it working as a small web-based tool that people in the design community can bookmark and revisit, especially when they‚Äôre stuck or need a laugh during critique time.

Designers seek growth

Feedback fuels our shared journeys

Let‚Äôs smile as we learn

### Session 2: 29 May

#### A3 Progress

My project is rooted in a Community of Practice I actively engage in ‚Äî the UI/UX design community.

---

**Community of Practice**

UIUX Design Community

- **Domain:** User Experience Design, User Interface Design
- **Repertoire:** Wireframing, prototyping, Figma
- **Values:** Constructive feedback, knowledge sharing, inclusivity, and continuous learning.
- Example activity: Members share work-in progress, tutorials, desgn resources, and get feedback or participate in portfolio review events.

In this CoP, sharing work and offering feedback is one of the most active practices. My project reflects, satirizes, and celebrates this ritual, turning it into something performative and creative.

---

#### Project Concept:

As someone immersed in the UI/UX design community ‚Äî both online and within university ‚Äî I‚Äôve come to deeply appreciate how essential feedback is for creative growth. Whether it's through critique sessions, comment threads, or peer reviews, designers thrive on feedback. However, I also noticed that the process of giving and receiving feedback often feels formal, stressful, or repetitive.

To shift this dynamic, I‚Äôm designing a UI/UX Feedback Generator ‚Äî a playful web-based tool that turns feedback into a relaxing, humorous, and interesting experience. Drawing inspiration from meme culture, internet slang, and design community in-jokes, the tool delivers light-hearted yet recognizably ‚Äúreal‚Äù feedback responses. It‚Äôs a fun reflection of the vibrant, weird, and creative exchanges that often happen in design communities ‚Äî especially online.

---

#### Mycelial Creativity in Action

My project responds to Lauren Lee McCarthy‚Äôs approach by engaging socially through code ‚Äî not just building a tool, but performing a reflection on how feedback works in our culture. This aligns with Mycelial Creativity, which frames creative work as a constantly growing, connecting network.

- **Omnidirectional growth:**

My idea evolved from multiple directions ‚Äî real critique experiences, memes in the design community, internet slang, and emotional design theories.

- **Accumulative growth:**

The project collects language, tones, and feedback styles that have accumulated across my design journey and community interactions.

- **Transformational growth:**

I‚Äôm reshaping a traditionally formal process (design critique) into a performative, humorous experience that invites users to reflect on feedback differently.

- **Brokering:**

This tool acts as a bridge between serious design critique and internet culture, translating technical language into engaging, funny, even absurd formats that are still insightful.

- **Fruting Body:**

The final interactive webpage is the "fruiting body" ‚Äî a public-facing artifact of this mycelial network of creative practice, coded culture, and community insight.

---

#### Why it is interesting?

Using Ngai‚Äôs aesthetic registers, this project pushes feedback into the zany (chaotic, hyperactive energy), the cute (approachable, light-hearted interface), and the interesting (sparks curiosity and invites interaction). These emotional tones are often missing in traditional critique tools ‚Äî but they‚Äôre alive and well in how real communities interact online.
