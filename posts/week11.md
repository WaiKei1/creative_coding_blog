#### A3 Progress

My project is rooted in a Community of Practice I actively engage in — the UI/UX design community.

---

**Community of Practice**

UIUX Design Community

- **Domain:** User Experience Design, User Interface Design
- **Repertoire:** Wireframing, prototyping, Figma
- **Values:** Constructive feedback, knowledge sharing, inclusivity, and continuous learning.
- Example activity: Members share work-in progress, tutorials, desgn resources, and get feedback or participate in portfolio review events.

In this CoP, sharing work and offering feedback is one of the most active practices. My project reflects, satirizes, and celebrates this ritual, turning it into something performative and creative.

---

#### Project Concept:

As someone immersed in the UI/UX design community — both online and within university — I’ve come to deeply appreciate how essential feedback is for creative growth. Whether it's through critique sessions, comment threads, or peer reviews, designers thrive on feedback. However, I also noticed that the process of giving and receiving feedback often feels formal, stressful, or repetitive.

To shift this dynamic, I’m designing a UI/UX Feedback Generator — a playful web-based tool that turns feedback into a relaxing, humorous, and interesting experience. Drawing inspiration from meme culture, internet slang, and design community in-jokes, the tool delivers light-hearted yet recognizably “real” feedback responses. It’s a fun reflection of the vibrant, weird, and creative exchanges that often happen in design communities — especially online.

---

#### Mycelial Creativity in Action

My project responds to Lauren Lee McCarthy’s approach by engaging socially through code — not just building a tool, but performing a reflection on how feedback works in our culture. This aligns with Mycelial Creativity, which frames creative work as a constantly growing, connecting network.

- **Omnidirectional growth:**

My idea evolved from multiple directions — real critique experiences, memes in the design community, internet slang, and emotional design theories.

- **Accumulative growth:**

The project collects language, tones, and feedback styles that have accumulated across my design journey and community interactions.

- **Transformational growth:**

I’m reshaping a traditionally formal process (design critique) into a performative, humorous experience that invites users to reflect on feedback differently.

- **Brokering:**

This tool acts as a bridge between serious design critique and internet culture, translating technical language into engaging, funny, even absurd formats that are still insightful.

- **Fruting Body:**

The final interactive webpage is the "fruiting body" — a public-facing artifact of this mycelial network of creative practice, coded culture, and community insight.

#### Why it is interesting?

Using Ngai’s aesthetic registers, this project pushes feedback into the zany (chaotic, hyperactive energy), the cute (approachable, light-hearted interface), and the interesting (sparks curiosity and invites interaction). These emotional tones are often missing in traditional critique tools — but they’re alive and well in how real communities interact online.
