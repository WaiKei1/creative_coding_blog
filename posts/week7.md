# Notes

### [Shaders](https://blog.science.family/250413_shaders)

**Conclusion:**

Shaders are small programs that run on the GPU to control how graphics are rendered, especially how shapes and pixels appear on the screen. While they can be used to create moving colors or dynamic effects, shaders are not just "colors that move" — they are powerful tools for generating visuals, including lighting, textures, animations, and interactive patterns. By using programming languages like GLSL, developers can make real-time visual effects that respond to time, user input, and more.

### Moiré

Moiré is a visual effect that occurs when two or more repetitive patterns—such as lines, dots, or grids—overlap and interfere with each other, creating a new, often wavy or rippling pattern that wasn’t in the original images.

#### Moiré vs. Glitch Effects

**Moiré**

Moiré is a structured, pattern-based distortion (e.g., wavy lines, rainbow ripples) caused by physical or optical interference (like overlapping grids or sensor limitations). It’s often repetitive and predictable in its appearance.

Example: A finely striped shirt on camera creates swirling waves.

**Glitch Effects**

Glitch effects are unpredictable, chaotic digital errors (e.g., pixel tears, color noise, fragmented images) caused by data corruption, signal loss, or intentional manipulation. They feel "broken" or unstable.

Example: A corrupted JPEG has random pixel blocks or a VHS tape skips violently.
