# Notes

### Communities of Practice

Groups of people who share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly.

They will share a specific area of interest (domain) and interact regularly which includes share knowledge, help each other and build relationship. Through this interaction, they will engage in shared activities to create resources or guides which can help them improve their practice together.

It’s not just about having similar interests — it’s about actively learning from each other, building collective expertise, and contributing to shared knowledge over time.

### Mycelial Creativity

Mycelial means underground fungal structure that are interconnected, decentralized and mutually supportive.

It is a metaphor that describe creative network has a similar features - spreading ideas, growth, and making connections。

### Session 1: 1 May

![hw8a_1](/w08s1/hw8a_1.png)

I decided to upgrade my existing blog instead of starting a brand new one.

After following the instructions, I moved all the code from the blog index file into a new file called blog.tsx. This means the index.tsx file is now free to be used as the main landing page, while the blog list can be accessed via /blog.

For the landing page, I wanted to keep things simple with a minimalist style that would match with the blog page. At first, I created a very plain layout—just some centered content—but it felt too empty and a bit boring. So, I decided to play around with the background colour to give it more life, and this is what I ended up with:

![landingpage](/w08s1/landingpage.png)

I chose a blue tone for the background because it felt calming and clean, which fits the vibe I’m going for. The landing page includes a headline that says "Welcome to my blog," with a short description underneath that explains what the blog is about. Below that, I added a call-to-action button that takes visitors to the blog list page.

![hw8a_3](/w08s1/hw8a_3.png)

For A3 I want to go with **UIUX Design Community**. This community is highly collaborative and often engages in feedback sessions where members review and critique each other’s work. Here’s one of my initial ideas based on this practice:

### UIUX feedback generator

This concept stems directly from the community itself—where feedback is a central part of the design process. But to make this idea more engaging, I thought it would be really fun to design a feedback generator that includes some light-hearted roasting, alongside typical constructive feedback.

**Why it’s interesting:** (From Ngai’s perspective)

**Zany:** The unexpected, almost absurd mix of genuine feedback with playful roasting gives the experience a zany feel. It’s chaotic, energetic, and entertaining—much like the vibe of many creative design critiques, but exaggerated. The idea embraces humor and unpredictability, which could keep users engaged while also disarming the stress that often comes with receiving critique.

**Cute:** The interface could use rounded shapes, soft colors, and animated elements to make the tool feel more friendly and approachable. Even the roast feedback could be written in a way that’s cheeky but charming. This use of cuteness makes the critique process feel less intimidating and more like an encouraging interaction between friends.

**Interesting:** Beyond just being funny, the tool could encourage reflection on how feedback is perceived and delivered in the design process. By blending critique with humor, users might start to reconsider the emotional tone of traditional feedback, leading to more thoughtful engagement with critique culture.

### Session 2: 6 May

![hw8b_1](/w08s2/hw8b_1.png)

For this live coding performance task, I teamed up with Jolie. Before we jumped into coding, we spent some time exploring the Hydra and Strudel websites to get familiar with the platforms and understand the basics.

We both agreed to keep things simple—we just wanted to play around and experiment with visuals and sounds rather than build something super complex. The goal was to enjoy the process and learn more about live coding together.

During the session, we visited the following websites to help guide our coding:

**1. Hydra**

- [Hydra Book](https://hydra-book.glitch.me/#/)
- [Hydra Sketch](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/?sketch_=&sketch_id=eerie_ear_2)

**2. Strudel**

- [Strudel Workshop](https://strudel.cc/workshop/first-sounds/)
- [Strudel Examples](https://strudel.cc/)

  \*CLICK SHUFFLE TO EXPLORE MORE CODE

These resources helped us understand the syntax and structure of both Hydra and Strudel.

- This is the final outcome - [Final Outcome](https://flok.cc/s/medieval-harlequin-krill-c9bbd374#)
- Watch our performance - [Collab Live Coding Performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXhukJ8WTfE)

As mentioned in the video, I was in charge of the Strudel (sound) part. For the audio, I chose to recreate the classic piano piece "Für Elise". The reason I picked this song is because it’s one of my most memorable pieces from childhood—I clearly remember struggling to play it with my left hand when I was learning piano.

[TOPLAP](https://blog.toplap.org/)

[ICLC 2025(TOPLAP)](https://iclc.toplap.org/2025/)

**- Domain:** The shared interest in live coding as both a creative and technical practice. This community explores coding as a real-time performance art, blending programming with music, visuals, and digital expression.

**- Repertoire:** A wide range of platforms, tools, and coding environments—such as TidalCycles, Sonic Pi, and Hydra—enables coders to collaborate, perform, and learn from one another. These shared practices include improvisation, algorithmic thinking, and live performance.

**- Values:** The community values inclusivity, experimentation, and open collaboration. It welcomes coders from all backgrounds across the internet, encouraging interaction, creativity, and the breaking of traditional boundaries between artist and audience.
