# Notes

### WebRTC

WebRTC: Real-time communication for video, voice, or P2P data sharing.

---

### WebSockets

WebSockets: Real-time, two-way messaging over a single connection (good for chat, notifications, live updates).

---

# Homework

### Session 1: 15 May

![hw10](/w10s1/hw10a_1.png)

In this task, I first researched about WebSockets and WebRTC and I came with these ideas:

1. Live Feedback Sessions

Multiple users give or given feedback at a same time.

2. Streaming responses

From an AI server instead of static feedback cards.

---

Based on these ideas, the technical aspects that I need to learn are:

1. Learn about the fundamental of WebSocket, includes how to open and manage persistent client-server connections.

2. Real-time communication protocols and message broadcasting

3. Learn about backend tools like Node.js, Socket.io etc.

4. security and privacy concerns: how to protect user data in real-time exchange.

---

**But I decided NOT TO USE these APIs (FOR NOW)**

After exploring the potential use of WebSockets and WebRTC for my AT3 project — a playful, AI-assisted UI/UX feedback generator for designers — I made a clear decision not to implement them.

It was an intentional design choice based on the following reasons:

**1. Privacy & Psychological Safety Are Core to My Concept**

The essence of my tool is to make designers feel safe, comfortable, and entertained when receiving feedback. I want them to interact with the system in their own time, without the pressure of being observed, judged, or needing to respond live.

Real-time systems like WebRTC/WebSockets often imply visibility, presence, or interaction with others — all of which could make users feel less secure or more exposed.

By keeping the system asynchronous and self-contained, I protect the mental and emotional space of the user.

**2. Real-Time Tech Doesn’t Match the Core Experience**

WebRTC and WebSockets are ideal for live collaboration, streaming, or peer-to-peer sharing — none of which are necessary for a tool that simply generates feedback based on a design input.

The feedback experience I want to create is reflective, thoughtful, and occasionally surprising — not something that needs to happen in real time.

Adding real-time technology would not enhance the core experience — in fact, it might distract from it.

**3. Mycelial Creativity: Slow Growth, Deep Connection**

The concept of Mycelial Creativity — where creative ideas grow in a decentralized, interwoven way like fungi networks — also shaped my approach.

Instead of a top-down, hierarchical system or a live broadcast model, my website is a quiet, evolving network. Each user contributes a design, chooses how to receive feedback, and has the option to engage with others’ uploaded pieces. Over time, this builds a creative feedback ecosystem that is:

- Personalized

- Emotional

- Emergent

Just like in natural mycelial systems, each small, individual interaction strengthens the health of the whole network. It doesn’t need to be live to be alive.

My goal is to nurture creative energy in a calm, playful, and emotionally safe space. Real-time technology isn’t necessary for that. In fact, by stepping away from constant connectivity, I’m giving users room to reflect, laugh, and grow — on their own terms.

And in doing so, I’m embracing the quiet power of mycelial creativity: small acts of design, feeding a larger, living ecosystem.

### Session 2: 20 May

![hw10b](/w10s2/hw10b.png)

I chose Manim (Python)

This is the Tutorial Series that I found:

<iframe id="Tutorial" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FlFEpb5GlZk?si=F8Z_WIWeJhBC6h1A" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<script type="module">

    console.log (`hello world! 🚀`)

    const iframe  = document.getElementById (`Tutorial`)
    iframe.width  = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
    iframe.height = iframe.width * 9 / 16

</script>

**Why chose Manim?**

I chose Manim because it blends code with motion graphics — something I can use for presentations, portfolios, or storytelling. As a UI/UX student, I can see myself using it to prototype animated UI flows, explain user journeys, or visualize ideas.

**How I might use it**

- Creating animated case studies for UX design portfolios

- Explaining processes (e.g., user journeys or design systems)

- Visualizing feedback loops or interaction flow in a stylish way

**Strengths of Manim**

| Strengths                      | Weaknesses                               |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Precise, programmable motion   | Steeper learning curve                   |
| Reusable code & animations     | Slower workflow than drag-and-drop tools |
| Great for education & diagrams | Not designed for real-time interactivity |

**Scripting vs Compiled Languanges**

| Scripting Languages             | Compiled Languages                    |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Faster prototyping              | Better performance                    |
| Easier to debug                 | Stricter syntax & more error checking |
| More flexible for creative work | More efficient for large systems      |
