# Introduction

In this post, I explore how my interactive website, UIUX Feedback Frenzy, responds to the ideas of Lauren Lee McCarthy, while also reflecting the values of Communities of Practice and Mycelial Creativity. This project was designed for the UI/UX design community to make the feedback process more fun, interactive, and emotionally engaging.

# Inspiration Stage

### Responding to Lauren Lee McCarthy

Lauren Lee McCarthy is known for creating performative and interactive systems that explore relationships between technology, surveillance, intimacy, and control.

Her use of play, vulnerability, and interpersonal feedback loops made me think about how digital tools can create more human-centred experiences ‚Äî not just functional interfaces.

My project was inspired in part by Lauren Lee McCarthy‚Äôs work ‚Äî especially how she uses code to reveal emotional layers of interaction. Just like her projects ask questions about care, automation, and intimacy, my feedback website explores how digital tools can change the tone of critique ‚Äî making it more playful, supportive, or even brutally honest depending on the user‚Äôs mood.

---

### My Community of Practice: UI/UX Designers

I chose to focus on the UI/UX design community, which I‚Äôve been part of through online forums like UX Beginner and The Design Kids. In these communities, designers share their work, give and receive feedback, and learn through critique and iteration.

Feedback plays a central role in this community ‚Äî it's how designers grow. However, asking for feedback can often feel intimidating, formal, or even discouraging. That‚Äôs why I wanted to create a tool that made this experience more welcoming and lighthearted.

---

**Domain**

The domain of the UI/UX design community is focused on user interface and experience design ‚Äî creating digital products that are intuitive, accessible, and enjoyable. Members share a passion for improving design skills, understanding user behavior, and exploring creative solutions to design challenges.

This shared domain gives members a sense of belonging and motivation to participate in discussions and activities.

---

**Repertoire**

The repertoire consists of the shared resources, tools, language, stories, and routines that members use. The UI/UX community has a rich repertoire including:

- Common terminology (wireframes, prototypes, usability testing)

- Tools and platforms (Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch)

- Routines such as portfolio reviews, design critiques, and feedback sessions

- Shared narratives of career growth and design challenges

---

**Values**

The values represent the shared principles, priorities, and attitudes held by the community. Core values in the UI/UX design community include:

- **Collaboration and knowledge sharing** ‚Äî members actively give and receive constructive feedback

- **Continuous learning** ‚Äî openness to new techniques and critiques for self-improvement

- **User empathy** ‚Äî prioritizing the needs and feelings of end users in design decisions

---

### Inspiration from communities

I looked at two specific community platforms for inspiration:

1. **UX Beginner: Design Community**

![UX beginner](/A3/uxbeginner.png)

A forum where people post screenshots and ask for help, critique, or advice. The directness of these posts made me realize how valuable, but also how vulnerable, asking for feedback can be.

2. **The Design Kids**

![The Design Kids](/A3/the%20design%20kids.png)

Their folio review events emphasize peer feedback. It‚Äôs routine, expected, and celebrated ‚Äî which gave me the idea to build something that gamifies or celebrates feedback through design.

# Ideation Stage

### Initial Idea

This concept stems directly from the community itself‚Äîwhere feedback is a central part of the design process. But to make this idea more engaging, I thought it would be really fun to design a feedback generator that includes some light-hearted roasting, alongside typical constructive feedback.

**Why it‚Äôs interesting:** (From Ngai‚Äôs perspective)

**Zany:** The unexpected, almost absurd mix of genuine feedback with playful roasting gives the experience a zany feel. It‚Äôs chaotic, energetic, and entertaining‚Äîmuch like the vibe of many creative design critiques, but exaggerated. The idea embraces humor and unpredictability, which could keep users engaged while also disarming the stress that often comes with receiving critique.

**Cute:** The interface could use rounded shapes, soft colors, and animated elements to make the tool feel more friendly and approachable. Even the roast feedback could be written in a way that‚Äôs cheeky but charming. This use of cuteness makes the critique process feel less intimidating and more like an encouraging interaction between friends.

**Interesting:** Beyond just being funny, the tool could encourage reflection on how feedback is perceived and delivered in the design process. By blending critique with humor, users might start to reconsider the emotional tone of traditional feedback, leading to more thoughtful engagement with critique culture.

---

### Final Concept: UIUX Feedback Frenzy

Building on the initial idea, I enhanced the interactivity by adding a feedback input section, allowing users to type and view responses tied to each design. While the original concept focused on delivering randomized feedback, this update creates a more communal and reciprocal experience ‚Äî echoing the interconnected, mycelial nature of design communities.

This idea originated within the design community itself, where feedback is a core ritual for growth. As a UI/UX student and active participant in communities like UX Beginner and The Design Kids, I observed that while feedback is invaluable, it can often feel intimidating or overly formal. So I created UIUX Feedback Frenzy ‚Äî a playful, interactive platform that lets users upload a design and receive feedback in the tone of their choice: Roast Me, Make it Cute, or Be Helpful.

Rather than framing critique as a formal or stressful task, I wanted to make it emotionally expressive, fun, and personally customizable.

**Why it‚Äôs interesting:** (From Ngai‚Äôs perspective)

**üåÄ Zany:** The generator embraces absurdity ‚Äî bouncing emojis, randomized speech bubbles, and cheeky ‚Äúroast‚Äù messages create moments of surprise. This chaotic energy mirrors the often unpredictable, performative dynamic of design critiques, making the act of giving and receiving feedback feel alive and playful.

**üß∏ Cute:** From the soft colors and rounded UI elements to floating emojis and animated faces, the interface is designed to disarm users. Even the roast messages are written with charm, turning what might be a moment of anxiety into something friendly and amusing.

**ü§™ Interesting:** At its core, the project reflects on how feedback is framed. By letting users select the emotional tone of their critique experience, it invites reflection on the how, not just the what, of feedback. It poses an important question: Can feedback be more than functional? Can it be joyful, aesthetic, or even performative?

# Mycelial Creativity

The concept of Mycelial Creativity ‚Äî where creative ideas grow in a decentralized, interwoven way like fungi networks ‚Äî also shaped my approach.

Instead of a top-down system, my website allows each user to contribute a design, choose how to receive feedback, and engage with others‚Äô uploads. Over time, this builds a creative feedback ecosystem, where responses are personalized, emotional, and emergent.

Just like in mycelial systems, each interaction is small but contributes to the health of the whole network.

# Final A3: UIUX Feedback Frenzy

For my final project, I created UIUX Feedback Frenzy, an interactive website that invites designers to upload their work and receive playful, personalized feedback through animated emojis and fun response styles, fostering a supportive and engaging community experience.

# Reflection

While building the site, I faced challenges with animation timing and styling, especially to get the right balance between fun and functionality.

I also learned that playful design can lower emotional barriers. People who tested the site were more willing to give and receive feedback because the interface felt less intimidating and more human.

In conclusion, this project helped me reflect on how tools shape community culture ‚Äî and how design decisions can invite more vulnerability, honesty, and joy.

By blending Lauren Lee McCarthy‚Äôs ideas, Mycelial Creativity, and my own experiences in UI/UX communities, I created something that not only works but feels alive.
