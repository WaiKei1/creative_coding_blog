# Chosen Text and Passages

### Chosen Text

**What Is It Like to Be A Fungus? by Merlin Sheldrake**

Brief summary of the text:

The author uses fungi as a metaphor to encourage us to rethink how we live and perceive intelligence. We often associate intelligence and skills with the brain, but the author points to an experiment involving slime molds—organisms without brains—that can find the most efficient path through obstacles. This challenges our traditional ideas about intelligence and suggests that it’s not just about the brain.

The author also questions the concept of individuality, noting that humans are made up of a vast network of microbes, which play a significant role in our health. This suggests that the idea of a single, isolated individual is misleading, as we are part of a much larger system. This challenges our conventional understanding of what it means to be an individual.

---

### Three passages that speak loudest

> **“Slime molds... can find the shortest route through a maze, make decisions based on past experiences, and solve complex problems—all without a brain.”**

This challenges the traditional idea that intelligence must be linked to a brain. It shows that fungi, despite not having a nervous system, can still solve problems and adapt to their environment. In a way, it proves that fungi have their own kind of intelligence—just not in the form we’re used to recognizing.

(indicate fungi are smart - solve problems and adapt)

---

> **“Fungi form vast, branching networks of mycelium that weave through soil and wood, connecting and communicating across long distances.”**

Fungi are far more present in our world than we usually notice. These mycelium networks stretch through the soil and forests, forming connections and even communicating over long distances. It suggests that fungi are not isolated organisms but part of a much larger, living system that surrounds and supports us.

(Their mycelium networks spread everywhere, silently connecting and communicating across long distances)

---

> **“We are ecosystems, composed of and maintained by countless microbes. The idea of an individual starts to fray when viewed through the lens of microbial life.”**

This makes me rethink what it means to be an individual. If our bodies are made up of and kept alive by trillions of microbes, can we really consider ourselves a single entity? It blurs the boundary between self and other and reminds us that life is much more interconnected than we might think.

(Like fungal networks, we as individuals are made up of countless connections—microbial ecosystems that challenge the idea of being just one.)

---

_\* One more passage to support my idea_

> **Fungi are metabolic wizards that can explore, scavenge, and salvage ingeniously, and their mycelial networks can fuse, fracture, and re-form**

---

# Inspiration Stage

Inspired by the chosen texts and passages, I wanted to create a visual interpretation of a mycelial network that highlights the interconnection between humans and fungi. This conceptual link led me to research the life cycle of fungi and the structure of mycelium as the core inspiration for my A2.

### Mycelium

![mycelium](/A2/mycelium_web.jpg)

**Mycelium** (plural: mycelia) is a root-like structure of a fungus, made up of a mass of branching, thread-like hyphae. These networks play a vital role in communication, nutrient exchange, and survival within ecosystems—paralleling how humans are interconnected biologically and socially.

---

### Life Cycle of a Mushroom

**Reference Article:**

[Medicinal importance of mushroom mycelium: Mechanisms and applications](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2019.03.016)

![mushroomlifecycle](/A2/fungi's%20lifecycle.jpg)

The second chapter: mushroom and their mycelium indicates that mycelium has been identified as the largest living organism on earth. The image above shows the life cycle of a mushroom.

Here is another image showing mushroom's life cycle.

![lifecycle2](/A2/lifecycle2.webp)

Through these two images, I developed the idea of illustrating the mushroom life cycle—beginning with spores being released from a mature mushroom. Once these spores land in an environment with sufficient moisture and nutrients, they germinate and grow into hyphae. These hyphae eventually form a young mushroom, which matures and continues the cycle by releasing new spores.

This cyclical process inspired the conceptual structure of my work, which I distilled into four stages: **scatter → fuse → fracture → reform**. These stages metaphorically reflect both the fungal lifecycle and the interconnected, ever-evolving nature of human identity.

---

### Code Inspiration

I found inspiration in an [interactive video showcasing shape transformations](https://www.youtube.com/embed/REPypjSeoRs?si=GuCoyfQsQjKApcv3) driven by mouse interaction. The organic, flowing movement of the shapes closely resembles how I envision the spores spreading.

# Ideation Stage

### Summary of my idea

I want to create an abstract mycelial network that visualizes the life of fungi. The network will shift through different modes to represent each stage of fungal behavior: **scatter → fuse → fracture → reform**. But then I realise the fuse stage is similar to the reform stage, so I've removed as I want each stage to feel distinct, both visually and sonically.

Each mode highlights a different aspect of fungal intelligence showing how they move, connect, adapt, and grow. This network isn’t just about fungi, though. It reflects the idea of non-human intelligence, how something without a brain can still solve problems and communicate.

At the same time, the entire cycle acts as a metaphor for how individuals are formed. Like fungi, we’re not just one thing—we’re made up of countless connections, microbial ecosystems, and invisible systems that shape who we are.

---

### Visual Design

The interactive visual will consist of four looping stages:
**Scatter → Fracture → Reform → Scatter**,
emphasizing the constant, cyclical motion of spores as they move, interact, and reorganize. Each stage will be triggered through a click or press interaction, allowing users to transition between phases.

---

**Canvas Background:**

The canvas will have a green background, chosen to evoke the tone of nature and life. It sets the scene for the fungal lifecycle and symbolizes the forest floor—where most fungal activity occurs.

---

**1. Stage 1: Scatter (Spore Dispersal)**

This stage represents the initial release and dispersal of spores. Visually, it will begin with a cluster of small dots at the center of the canvas that scatter outward randomly, filling the space with motion and energy.

To determine the color palette of the spores, I researched spore coloration using this reference: [Spore Color | Mushroom](https://www.mushroomthejournal.com/spore-color/#:~:text=Most%20spores%20are%20some%20shade,color%20of%20the%20mushroom's%20spores.)

The findings indicate most spores appear in shades of white, pink, brown, and black, with rare hues such as orange, yellow, and green. I will incorporate these colors to create a natural yet visually diverse display of spores.

**2. Stage 2: Fracture (Mycelial Emergence)**

This stage visualizes the formation of mycelial networks, interpreted through the concept of "fracture." Dots (spores) that are close in proximity will begin to connect with white lines, creating a web-like structure.

To express the unstable, trial-and-error nature of these early connections, I will incorporate glitch effects, symbolizing the experimental and fragmented process of fungal networking.

**3. Stage 3: Reform**

This stage brings a sense of resolution and cohesion. Spores will once again connect—but this time through red lines, signaling a more purposeful, mature stage of connection.

Once connected, the network will flash briefly, and the spores will gradually merge into a single dot, symbolizing the formation of a unified organism or idea. The tone here shifts from chaotic to calm and intentional—a moment of clarity.

---

### Sound Design

I will create three looping sound environments, each designed to evoke a different quality of movement and transformation in the fungal system. The original sounds are from [Freesound](https://freesound.org/). I downloaded them and edit to make it fits.

**1. Stage 1: Scatter – Calm Chaos**

_[original sound](https://freesound.org/people/gis_sweden/sounds/786156/)_

This stage shows spores drifting randomly. The sound will be soft and ambient, like natural chaos—similar to **MyNoise Jungle or Fire**, with scattered textures and no strong structure. It represents calm unpredictability and sits between noise and sound, encouraging listeners to rethink how we hear “movement.”

**2. Stage 2: Fracture – Unstable Connections**

_[original sound](https://freesound.org/people/CVLTIV8R/sounds/796980/)_

As the spores start glitching and bouncing to connect, the sound becomes sharper and tighter. I’ll use high-pitched glitches. It’s unstable and chaotic, showing the tension in making connections.

**3. Stage 3: Reform – Nervous Convergence**

_[original sound](https://freesound.org/people/FS_D/sounds/582995/)_

Spores begin to come together and reposition. The sound here is nervous and fast, with twitchy rhythms and slight structure—but still unstable. It suggests a fragile order that never fully settles, showing how systems try to come together but remain in constant motion.

---

In the sonic domain, chaos doesn’t mean total randomness—it means unpredictability within a system that still holds shape. That’s the essence of effective complexity, where the richness of the sound arises from its refusal to fully conform to order or dissolve into noise.

By using sound to mirror fungal intelligence, I want to challenge traditional listening habits—blurring distinctions between noise and music, nature and machine, self and system. Through de-familiarisation (as Natalie Loveless discusses), I hope to reframe fungi as more than background organisms—inviting audiences to experience their agency and strangeness through shifting, layered, and unstable sounds.

---

### Techniques that I'll use in A2

**Techniques:**

- **Signals / Envelopes**

  I will use signals/envelopes to control the transitions between each stage of the network’s behavior—guiding the way forms scatter, come together, break apart, and reform smoothly or chaotically, mimicking natural processes.

- **Glitch**

  I will incorporate glitch techniques to represent the moment of connection between different parts of the network. When new links form, they will visually bounce and glitch—creating a sense of unstable, flickering energy—as if the system is actively searching, reaching, and locking into new pathways.

---

## Feedback

This feedback is given based on the draft above.

**Feedback Summary:**

I think the way you’ve tied your piece to the text about fungi and non-human intelligence works really well. The idea that fungi can adapt and solve problems without a brain seems to connect perfectly to your approach with the shifting, interconnected mycelial network. The reference to microbial life further strengthens the idea of intelligence being more distributed than we usually think, which is spot on.

It’s definitely post-digital! By incorporating glitch aesthetics, you’re showing how digital systems don’t always behave in the clean, predictable ways we expect. The glitching as the mycelial connections form makes the process of connection itself feel uncertain and unpredictable, which ties into the whole idea of technology’s chaotic nature. I like that you're not just using digital techniques for the sake of it, but to make a statement about how systems behave.

I really like how you’re using chaotic aesthetics to express the complexity of the natural world. The mycelial network isn’t static—it’s constantly evolving. This mirrors nature's real complexity, where things aren't always easy to understand but work together in ways we can’t always predict. The glitch elements add to the unpredictability, but they don’t overwhelm the piece. You’ve found a good balance between chaos and coherence.

# First Attempt

[First Attempt](https://waikei1-dms3-a2-32-1tygvw660swz.deno.dev/)

This is the first attempt I did to test if the outcome is what I expected, BUT I realised that it will be so funny if the spores is stuck within the edge of the canvas and the sound will be delayed if it straight away jumped to stage 1. Additionally, it's a bit lagging when change to fracture mode so I might reduce the amount of the spores.

Then I take another attempt.

    const iframe  = document.getElementById (`Final Assignment 2`)
    iframe.width  = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
    iframe.height = iframe.width * 9 / 16

</script>

---

Here's how my assignment 2 uses these concepts:

**Examples of how and where it uses:**

**1. Variables**

Variables are used throughout to store and track dynamic values such as `let mode = "scatter"`

---

**2. Iteration**

A for loop in p.setup() creates multiple spore objects:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
  spores.push(new Spore(p.width / 2, p.height / 2));
}
```

---

**3. Functions**

Functions are being used through all the entire sketch.

- p.setup(), p.draw(), p.mousdPressed
- custom functions: handleFractureMode() and handleReformMode()
- spore class also uses the custom methods `.update()` and `.display()`

---

**4. Boolean logic**

- `if (!audioStarted) { ... }` to ensure audio only starts once
- conditional statement (mode changes)

```javascript
  if (mode === "scatter") { ... }
  else if (mode === "fracture") { ... }
```

---

**5. Arrays**

- `let spores = [];` - spores arrat holds all individual spore objects

- `p.random([255, 255, 0, 0])` - random colour selection

---

**6. Classes**

spore class

```javascript
class Spore {
  constructor(x, y) { ... }
  update() { ... }
  display() { ... }
}
```

---

**7. Recursion**

    A form of recursive structure is mimicked visually in the reform mode:

    - The `lerp()` function slowly pulls spores toward each other over time, gradually forming connections.

    As spores move closer, they create new connections, which visually resembles recursive network growth. The cyclical looping and spatial relationships create the recursive visual logic.

---

**How it responds to the chosen text**

My idea for A2 is inspired by these 4 chosen passages:

> **“Slime molds... can find the shortest route through a maze, make decisions based on past experiences, and solve complex problems—all without a brain.”**

> **“Fungi form vast, branching networks of mycelium that weave through soil and wood, connecting and communicating across long distances.”**

> **“We are ecosystems, composed of and maintained by countless microbes. The idea of an individual starts to fray when viewed through the lens of microbial life.”**

> **Fungi are metabolic wizards that can explore, scavenge, and salvage ingeniously, and their mycelial networks can fuse, fracture, and re-form**

The first three passages helped shape the concept behind my work. I wanted to highlight the intelligence of fungi—even though they don’t have a brain, they can solve complex problems and adapt based on past experiences. They also build massive, interconnected networks through mycelium, which can be compared to how microbes connect and sustain our own bodies as humans. It shows that we, too, are made up of networks, not just as individuals but as ecosystems.

So I decided to represent that idea by visualising a mycelial network—how it grows, breaks, and comes together again. That part connects with the fourth quote, which specifically mentions the behaviour of fungi networks: they can scatter, fracture, and reform. That inspired the three-phase cycle in my work.

---

**Why you consider it to be post-digital**

I'd consider my work to be post-digital because it doesn’t just use digital tools—it critically engages with them to explore deeper, entangled relationships between humans and nature.

In this project, the digital medium becomes a means to visualize the invisible intelligence of the mycelial network, not as a gimmick, but as a conceptual framework. The fungi's interconnected system acts as a metaphor for the complexity of human identity—challenging the idea of the individual as separate or isolated.

This approach aligns with post-digital thinking, where technology is no longer the focus, but a quiet, embedded layer that supports a more nuanced exploration of life, networks, and systems. It’s about shifting attention from the tools themselves to the ideas they help us uncover.
