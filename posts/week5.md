# Notes

### Chaos

A state of utter disorder, randomness, and unpredictability where patterns are obscured or non-existent.

- In art: Used to challenge traditional notions of control and harmony.

---

### Net Art

Net Art (internet art), is art created specifically for and existing primarily on the internet, often leveraging digital tools, interactivity, or networked platforms.

_\* Cannot Exist Offline (born-digital)_

---

### Glitch

A visual or functional error caused by technical malfunctions, often producing unintended distortions.

**Artistic Value**

- Reveals hidden structures of digital systems (e.g., corrupted files exposing code).
- Challenges perfectionism in digital media.

---

### Beauty of the glitch

The aesthetic appreciation of errors as meaningful or poetic disruptions.

**Why It Matters:**

- Humanizes technology: Shows fragility beneath sleek interfaces.
- Creates uniqueness: No two glitches are identical.

---

### Chaotic Aesthetic Register

A visual language embracing disorder, dissonance, and unpredictability as formal qualities.

- Glitch art: Data corruption, pixel sorting.

- Generative algorithms: Noise, fractals, emergent patterns.

---

### Post-Digital

The post-digital refers to an artistic and cultural stance that no longer sees digital tech as new or exceptional but instead engages with its contradictions, failures, and embeddedness in everyday life.

- Rejects "clean" digital perfection (utopianism) in favor of glitches, artifacts, and obsolete tech.

- Blurs digital/analog boundaries (e.g., treating pixels as material).

- Critiques the myths of digital progress while still using digital tools.

# Group Task

1.  ![gw1](/w05s1/gw1.png)

**Explaination:**

- declaring w2h (width to height) into 2 arguements (\_, i)

- using the arrow function (a shorthand for writing function)

- return [^2]  
  [^2]: **return** is used to send values back from functions (serving a finished dish), without return is like recipes with no output (pointless)

---

<script src="./scripts/p5.js"></script>

<canvas id="p5_example"></canvas>

<script>
    const cnv = document.getElementById ("p5_example")
    const w = cnv.parentNode.scrollWidth
    const h = w * 9 / 16

    function setup () {
        createCanvas (w, h, P2D, cnv)
    }

    function draw () {
        background (`red`)
        console.log (frameCount)
    }





</script>
